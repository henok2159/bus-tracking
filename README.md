# bus-tracking

I worked on this project to improve Addis Abeba's bus service.
It has several characteristics, including the ability to locate 
the specified bus position for the passenger.When there is an issue,
drivers can report it to the bus managers. It also provides a controller
to the management, allowing for better task allocation, bus repair, and bus tracking.
